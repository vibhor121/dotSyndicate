# ✅ Admin Feature - View All Bookings

## What Was Added

I've successfully implemented the **Admin Dashboard** feature that allows admins to view all bookings from all users!

---

## 🎯 Features Implemented

### Backend (Already existed!)
- ✅ User role field (`user` or `admin`)
- ✅ Admin authentication middleware (`adminAuth`)
- ✅ Admin endpoint: `GET /api/bookings/all`

### Frontend (New!)
1. ✅ **Admin Dashboard Page** (`/admin/bookings`)
   - Beautiful table view of all bookings
   - Shows customer information (name, email)
   - Shows property details
   - Shows booking dates, guests, prices
   - Status badges (confirmed, cancelled, completed)
   - Statistics cards (total bookings, confirmed, revenue)

2. ✅ **Updated Navbar**
   - Shows "🛡️ Admin Dashboard" link for admin users only
   - Regular users won't see this link

3. ✅ **Protected Routes**
   - Non-admins are redirected if they try to access admin pages
   - Shows error message: "Admin access required"

---

## 🔐 Admin Credentials

To access the admin dashboard, login with:

```
Email: admin@staywise.com
Password: admin123
```

## 📊 Admin Dashboard Features

### Statistics Cards
- **Total Bookings**: Shows count of all bookings

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## 🔒 Security Features

1. **Backend Protection**
   - `/api/bookings/all` endpoint requires admin authentication
   - Returns 403 error if non-admin tries to access

2. **Frontend Protection**
   - Admin dashboard redirects non-admins to home page
   - Shows error toast: "Admin access required"
   - Admin link only visible to admin users

3. **Role-based Access**
   - User role is checked on both frontend and backend
   - Token includes role information

---

## 🎯 Benefits

1. **Complete Overview**: See all bookings from all users in one place
2. **User Information**: View customer details for each booking
3. **Revenue Tracking**: See total revenue across all bookings
4. **Status Management**: See booking statuses at a glance
5. **React Query**: Automatic caching and refetching
6. **Beautiful UI**: Professional table layout with hover effects

---

## 🔄 React Query Integration

The admin dashboard uses React Query for data fetching:

```typescript
const { data: bookings = [], isLoading } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['admin-bookings'],
  queryFn: async () => {
    const response = await api.get('/bookings/all');
    return response.data.bookings;
  },
  enabled: !!user && user.role === 'admin',
});
```

Benefits:
- ✅ Automatic loading states
- ✅ Automatic error handling
- ✅ Data caching
- ✅ Background refetching
- ✅ Only fetches if user is admin

---

## 🎓 For Your Understanding

### User Roles
- **Regular User (`role: 'user'`)**: Can view their own bookings
- **Admin (`role: 'admin'`)**: Can view ALL bookings from all users

### How It Works
1. Admin logs in with admin credentials
2. Backend creates JWT token with `role: 'admin'`
3. Frontend checks user role
4. Admin sees special "Admin Dashboard" link in navbar
5. When admin clicks it, frontend makes request to `/api/bookings/all`
6. Backend's `adminAuth` middleware checks if token has `role: 'admin'`
7. If yes → returns all bookings
8. If no → returns 403 error

---
